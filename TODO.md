# Update Application Feature Implementation

## Information Gathered
- ScholarController has showUpdateApplication and updateApplication methods for handling application updates.
- MayorStaffController has sendEmail method that sends emails with optional application issues.
- Migration adds update_token column to tbl_application_personnel table.
- update_application.blade.php view exists for the update form.

## Plan
- Modify MayorStaffController sendEmail method to generate update_token when application_issues are provided and include an update link in the email.
- Modify ScholarController showUpdateApplication method to verify the update_token from query parameters.
- Ensure the update link is signed and secure.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- app/Http/Controllers/MayorStaffController.php (sendEmail method)
- app/Http/Controllers/ScholarController.php (showUpdateApplication method)

## Followup Steps
- Test email sending with issues to ensure update_token is generated and link is included.
- Test accessing the update link to verify token validation.
- Ensure the update form only shows fields related to the issues.
