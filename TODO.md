# TODO: Restructure applicants_reg.blade.php into Tabbed Interface

## Steps to Complete:
- [ ] Update applicants_reg.blade.php: Restructure HTML into tabbed interface with 3 tabs (Personal Information, Educational Attainment, Application Requirements). Group fields accordingly and add tab navigation.
- [ ] Update application_reg.css: Make layout full-screen responsive (remove fixed heights, allow scrolling), improve CSS with better tab styling, spacing, and animations.
- [ ] Verify changes: Ensure form validation scripts still work and layout is responsive across screen sizes.
