FIND THE FUNCTION
Locate the populateEditModal function in your JavaScript code

This function fills the modal with existing data

2. ADD RENT FIELD DISPLAY LOGIC
Inside populateEditModal, after setting the house/lot values

Add code to directly show/hide the rent fields based on saved data

3. ENSURE CHANGE EVENTS WORK
Make sure the house and lot dropdowns trigger their change events

This will automatically show/hide rent fields when values change

4. TEST THE FIX
Open an existing intake sheet in the modal

Check if house_house value is loaded

Verify rent fields appear when value is "Rent"
